# Delaunay-Triangulation
Thanks to https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiyishou/p/4430017.html which provides an optimized algorithm for delaunay triangulation.
Implemented Delaunay Triangulation in Python.
## Class included:
  Tkinter Test board: graphics debugging
  
  Delaunay_Lawson: use a list of dots as input, and return a list of triangles.
  
  main_Board: use Tkinter GUI as main board. User can upload local images, use the app to process image, and save the processed image to local.
