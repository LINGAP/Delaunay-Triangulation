# Delaunay-Triangulation
Thanks to https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiyishou/p/4430017.html which provided a optimized algorithm for delaunay triangulation.
Implemented Delaunay Triangulation in Python.
## Class included:
  Tkinter Test board: graphics debugging
  
  Delaunay_Lawson: use a list of dots as input, and return a list of triangles.
